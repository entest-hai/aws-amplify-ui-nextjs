## How AmplifyProvider and Theme work with SCSS

**22 APR 200 Hai Tran**
Quote from the principale design engineer from AWS

```
When you use the <AmplifyProvider> it wraps all the children in a div with that data attribute, and then adds all the CSS variables the theme needs. Looking at that SCSS [data-amplify-theme] .docs-nav-link I don't think we actually need the [data-amplify-theme] part of the selector, it might be leftover from some refactoring.
That code is to make the theme switcher on the homepage of the site work. Rather than passing in entirely new theme objects to the AmplifyProvider, a theme can have overrides that change the theme based on certain conditions (like targeting a different selector in CSS, or for light/dark mode). If you look at theme.ts in the docs you will see some overrides with selectors, then in the homepage when you click on a theme button it applies that data attribute and the new theme css vars get applied. https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/theming#overrides

```

This is a great topic to dive in and share

### Hello SCSS

- selector
- @media
- variable
- document.documentElement.setAttribute()
